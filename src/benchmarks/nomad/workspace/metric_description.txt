Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated on the column-wise root mean squared logarithmic error.

The RMSLE for a single column calculated as

[
\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\log(p_i + 1) - \log(a_i + 1)\right)^2}
]

where:

\\(n\\) is the total number of observations
\\(p_i\\) is your prediction
\\(a_i\\) is the actual value
\\(\log(x)\\) is the natural logarithm of \\(x\\)

The final score is the mean of the RMSLE over all columns (in this case, 2).
